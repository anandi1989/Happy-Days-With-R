## Graphics with granddaddy

We might call [the Euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm) the granddaddy of all algorithms, because it is the oldest nontrivial algorithm that has survived to the present day.” – Donald Knuth, [The Art of Computer Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth), Vol. 2: Seminumerical Algorithms, 2nd edition (1981), p. 318.

This exercise is about two interesting graphics that can be produced with granddaddy: 

1. coprime/relative prime pairs (a, b)

2. the number of steps/iterations of the algorithm for each integer pair `(a, b)`. In either case, `a`, `b` are both between `0` and some integer `n`. The resulting `(n + 1) × (n + 1)` matrices have interesting structure that can visualized in the form of color-coded images.
