## Introduction

My happy days with **R** is a repository of all my assignment which I have done during my master's at [Centre for Modeling and Simulation](http://cms.unipune.ac.in) in 2015-16. 

All the details of the problemset and associated **R** code and outcomes is available in respective folder. 

If you see any mistake, please let me know by opening a new issue.
