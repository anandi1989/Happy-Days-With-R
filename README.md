## Introduction

**Happy-Days-With-R** is a repository of R assignments which I have solved during my master's at [Centre for Modeling and Simulation](http://cms.unipune.ac.in) in 2015-16. 

All the details of the problemset and associated **R** code and outcomes is available in respective folder. 

If you see any mistake, please let me know by opening a new issue. 

### Note
This exercise was part of the course, ***Perspectives of Probalibity Modeling - I***, instructed by [Dr. Mihir Arjunwadkar](http://cms.unipune.ac.in/~mihir/)
